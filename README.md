# PersonalManager

This project started with the goal of making a full 'life manager' in notion but notion has too many architectural constraints to make such a system. (by a single person with limited time and resources that is).
This project has been moved back into design and will change the framework its made with. (potentially nestjs and postgres@docker to garantee future updates keep the data safe.)
